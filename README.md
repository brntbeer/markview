Markview
========

Markview allows you to view markdown formatted files in a slick way. Markview is
inspired by the python library [restview](http://mg.pov.lt/restview/). This gem
is made possible by [Ryan Tomayko](http://github.com/rtomayko)'s [RDiscount](http://github.com/rtomayko/rdiscount) and
[samsoffes](http://github.com/samsoffes) and his brilliant [markdownr](http://github.com/samsoffes/markdownr.com).

Install
-------

New releases of Markview are published to [gemcutter](http://gemcutter.org/gems/markview)

	$ [sudo] gem install markview

Usage
-----

Markview is very simple to use. Run the gem from the command line and specify
the README. Markview is smart enough to find the README if you choose not to
specify the file.

	$ markview README.md
